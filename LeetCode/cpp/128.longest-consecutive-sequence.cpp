 * Total Submissions: 456.9K
 * Testcase Example:  '[100,4,200,1,3,2]'
 *
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest
 * consecutive elements sequence.
 * 
 * Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:Â [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
 * Therefore its length is 4.
