 *
 * You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in
 * words matches the pattern.
 * 
 * A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so
 * that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the
 * desired word.
 * 
 * (Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to
 * letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the
 * same letter.)
 * 
 * Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern. 
 * 
 * You may return the answer in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
 * Output: ["mee","aqq"]
 * Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a ->
 * m, b -> e, ...}. 
 * "ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a
 * permutation,
 * since a and b map to the same letter.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= words.length <= 50
 * 1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20
