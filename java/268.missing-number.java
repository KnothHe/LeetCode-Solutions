 * Testcase Example:  '[3,0,1]'
 *
 * Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n],
 * return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,0,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the
 * range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear
 * in nums.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [0,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the
 * range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear
 * in nums.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the
 * range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear
 * in nums.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == nums.length
 * 1 <= n <= 10^4
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= n
 * All the numbers of nums are unique.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space
 * complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?
